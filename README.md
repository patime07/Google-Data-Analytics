# Process Data from Dirty to Clean
Hello and thank you for visiting my GitHub repository!

This space has been dedicated to documenting my journey through Google's "Process Data from Dirty to Clean" course, offered via Coursera. In this course, I've gained valuable knowledge and experience working with various data sets, transforming "dirty" data into clean, ready-to-use information.

In this repository, you'll find a compilation of hands-on activities and projects I've worked on throughout the course. Please feel free to explore, provide feedback, or use these examples as references for your own data cleaning endeavors! 

Best,

Patime :)
